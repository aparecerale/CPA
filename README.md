###Purpose:

The objective of customer potential application is that we try to predict movies according to userâ€™s taste. Generally speaking, we have two methods, one is to find the similar movie. This one is based on movie datasets,  which downloaded from Kaggle. And another is to explore the similar user. This method is based on the watching history of users. We have to collect it from our web application.

For a platform its convenient to choose a web application since it has the ability to turn into a mobile site as well.

###How to deploy it on your computer:
1.Install Intelij IDEA. https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition
